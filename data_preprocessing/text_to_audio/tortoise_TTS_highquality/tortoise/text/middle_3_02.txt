Are there any dogs available for adoption today?
Yes, we have several puppies and older dogs.
Can I meet one of the puppies?
Of course! Let’s go to the play area.
This one is so friendly! What’s his name?
His name is Buddy. He’s very playful and loves people.
I think I’d love to adopt him!
That’s wonderful. We’ll help you with the adoption process.
Thanks! I’ve always wanted a dog.
Buddy will be so happy to have a new home.
