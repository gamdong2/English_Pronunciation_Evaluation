What kind of photos do you enjoy taking?
I mostly take nature photos, especially flowers.
That sounds beautiful. Do you have a favorite camera?
Yes, I like this one because it’s lightweight and easy to use.
Can I try it sometime?
Sure! Let’s plan a photo outing together.
Where would you like to go?
Maybe the botanical garden. There’s so much to capture there.
Great idea! Let’s set a date.
I can’t wait! I’ll bring my camera, too.
